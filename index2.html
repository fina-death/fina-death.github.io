<h1>My Trip Around the USA on a Segway</h1>
<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

<h3>August 20, 2012</h3>
<a href="images"><img src="images/segway1.jpg"></a>   
Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: 
<ol> 
	<li>Walla, WA,</li>
	<li> Magic City, ID,</li>
	<li> Bountiful, UT, </li>
	<li> Last Chance, CO,</li>
	<li> Truth or Consequences, NM,</li> 
	<li> Why, AZ</li> 
</ol>

<h5>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</h5>
<blockquote>  
"Passing cars, When you can't see,<br> May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."<br>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.
</blockquote>
<h3>June 2, 2012</h3>
<h5>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,</h5>
<h6>I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</h6>
	<ul> 
	<li>cellphone,</li>
	<li>iPod,</li> 
	<li>digital camera,</li>
	<li>and a protein bar</li>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
	</ul>
